# The following settings are critical because without them, CREATE2 same argument assumptions are broken if new
# Foundry libraries are added to the repository over time, via forge install. Forge build generates a different
# bytecode for a contract if a new foundry library is installed. Also, the metadata hash is included as part of
# the bytecode by default, which can prevent deterministic deployments with CREATE2.
